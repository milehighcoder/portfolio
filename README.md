## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio website that demonstrates my skills as a growing web developer as well as showcase web projects that I have been a part of prior to enrolling in Denver University's Coding Boot Camp.

## Project Challenges - Bootstrap and "@Font-Face"

Learning how to correctly utilize Bootstrap was a challenge at first as I needed to learn how to write proper syntax for containers, rows, and columns. The grid system that Bootstrap follows makes styling and placing elements in the page very simple and straightforward.

The biggest challenge I faced while working on this project was easily the "@Font-Face" rule. 

Upon initial launch of my application, the font on each of my pages was consistent with the custom font that I referenced in the CSS sheet on desktop browsers. However, when I went to view the appllication on a mobile device, it was the incorrect font and defaulted to a basic browser font.

After taking about an hour to figure out why the font wasn't displaying correctly on mobile browsers, I came across the "@Font-Face" rule and was able to get my code to display the custom font correctly.

## Conclusion

This was an extrememly enjoyable project as UX/UI design is my favorite aspect of web development. The Bootstrap framework allows for endless styling options too. Since I'm still new to coding and in the process of learning JavaScript, it will take some time before I can enable my contact form to store user entries. I can't wait to make an update to this application in the near future!
